# ARRuler 

This is an app capable of calculating the distance between two points in the real world using augmented reality. It's simple to use: just click on the screen on the edges to be measured, and the length appears along with the second point added. Could this be the end of the tape measure? 

Note: The app will still undergo design improvements, but it is already working as it should.
